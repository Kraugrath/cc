Here you go, Maravarman — simple, clean steps. No tension, no confusion. And yes, one joke included so you don’t fall asleep halfway. 😄

Install Google App Engine (Python) & Create a Simple Hello World App

1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.

Check version:

python3 --version


---

2. Install the Google Cloud SDK

Download & install Google Cloud SDK (gcloud):

Linux:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

Windows/macOS:
Use the installer from Google Cloud website (search: Google Cloud SDK installer).

Then initialize:

gcloud init


---

3. Install App Engine Python Components

gcloud components install app-engine-python
gcloud components update


---

4. Create Your Project Folder

mkdir myapp
cd myapp


---

5. Create main.py

This is your Hello World app:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World from App Engine!"


---

6. Install Flask

pip install flask


---

7. Create app.yaml

This tells App Engine how to run the app.

runtime: python39

entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app

handlers:
  - url: /.*
    script: auto


---

8. Test Locally

Install gunicorn:

pip install gunicorn

Run locally:

gunicorn -b :8080 main:app

Open browser →
http://localhost:8080


---

9. Deploy to Google App Engine

First create a project in GCP:

gcloud projects create your-project-id
gcloud config set project your-project-id

Then deploy:

gcloud app deploy

Open it:

gcloud app browse


---

10. Congratulate yourself

You deployed your first App Engine app.
If someone says this was hard, tell them:

> “Bro… even my morning coffee is more complicated.”

If you want, I can also give you examples of: ✔ Form handling
✔ Simple database (Firestore)
✔ Login page
✔ REST API

Just tell me.
